## Install

Install with pip:

```
pip install palabras
```

## Dev setup

You'll probably want to do this in a virtualenv or conda env, or using another isolation method of your choice.

Clone the repo and cd into the root directory:

```
git clone git@github.com:paavopere/palabras.git
cd palabras
```

Or start from here ðŸ‘‡ if you already got the repo and are in the root directory `palabras`.

Install the package from current directory with `[test]` dependencies in editable mode (`-e`):

```
pip install -e '.[test]'
```

### Checks

Run tests, linter, and type checks:

```
pytest --cov --cov-report=term-missing
flake8
mypy palabras --ignore-missing-imports
```

... or in one go:

```
tox
```

All checks should pass and test coverage should be 100% of lines.
